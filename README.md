# Project Description

This project is developed for cs319. IQ Puzzler Pro is a board game which improves players intelligence. It is beneficial especially for children in terms of concentration skill. This game appeals up to 6 to adult. Our aim is adapting the original IQPuzzlerPro board game to the digital platform. In our version, just like the original game, we have two boards and 12 puzzle pieces in different shapes and colors. The goal of each level is to fit each of the puzzle pieces together onto these boards as a grid for 2D game version. Also, it can be played in 3D by creating pyramids. In each level, we give some of the pieces on their correct places and we expect from user to fill the blanks with remaining pieces. At the first level, the user can't access the other levels and when the user passes the level, the next level will be unlocked. In each level, the difficulty level will be increased and given piece number will be decreased. In our version, if the user can complete the level in a specific time he/she will earn coin and these coins can be used to get a hint. In addition, there will be a multiplayer option for the game. In this option, users can select difficulty level as easy, medium and hard. Then, both users will play the same level in turn. The game will record the time of players and compare them. The player who completes the level in a shorter time will be the winner.
